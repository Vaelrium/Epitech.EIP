\section{Working environement}
The distributed revision control and source code management Git is used to profit from its efficiant branching system in order to avoid conflicts in the code base.
The Git repositories are hosted on Github, which also offers \textit{issues} and \textit{Wiki} functionaloty, providing us with a clear space to discuss the different aspects of the project, manage the comunity's contribution and maintain the documentation.\\

No other development environement is mandatory for people wanting to contribute. That is why it is verry important the repositories stay clean of any editor-related files.\\

The bigest part of the project will be coded in Python which is interpreted, dynamic typed and recognazied for its flexibility and stability.\\
All the produced Python code must respect the PEP8, which imposes several rules tending to produce cleaner code which is more easy to read and understand.\\

When possible the code must be easy to port on the majority of platforms. This work is eased by the use of the Python programing language, but still asks for particular attention.
