\section{Comminucation and marketing}
The main target of Onitu are technicaly-aware users, sensible to the way their data is stored and handled. Onitu also targets compagnies because they normaly have the same preocupations. This is not a broad-public which means the way we comunicate will have to be verry carefully choosen.

\subsection{Communication}
The main way of comunicating about Onitu is throigh the internet, and in particular specialised web sites and blogs talking about new technologies. We will have to convince those sites to write about Onitu in order to make it known to the audience.\\

On of the goals of Onitu is to be officially recognized by Canoncical, and so benifit from their comunication channels. This would be a verry strong oportunity to spread knowledge about the project.\\

\subsection{Marketing}
The name Onitu has been choosen to remember Ubuntu One, but to stand out. For the moment no other project is name Onitu and referencinf on popular search engines should not be a problem.\\

The graphic style of the project is not be defined. It will have to describe the colors associated to the project, as well as the typographical elements and a logo.\\

A website will be setup in order to describe the project and offer a user-guide and links to more detailed documentation.
