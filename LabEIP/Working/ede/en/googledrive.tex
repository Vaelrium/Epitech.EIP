\subsection{Presentation}
Google Drive is a storage web application in the cloud. It is a proprietary software, accessible from a website or different applications for some platforms

\subsection{Historical}
Google Documents is a webapp created in 2006, grouping spreadsheet, word processing and slideshow editor.
Launched in 2012, Google Drive succeeds it, adding a file hoster, available for many file types.\\

\subsection{Description}
This service inherits from Google Documents' features, like file sharing with other users, but also, by its interface, a simultaneous editing for a dcument (collaborative work).\\
The Google Drive's main contribution is probably the data synchronization with local files, which makes it a real service of cloud computing.\\
It fits perfectly with other Google applications like Google+ or Gmail.\\
\\
It offers capacities between 5Go and 16To, allowing a maximum of 10Go per file, and has specific applications for Windows, Mac OS, Android, and shortly for iOS.\\

\subsection{Criticism}
Behind an intuitive interface and pleasant to use, there is a problem quite annoying: centralized data escape user. He has no effect in control over his data, and the closed source code of the application prevents to create an alternative on other platform.
