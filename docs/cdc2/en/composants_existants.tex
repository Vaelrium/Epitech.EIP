Several existing clients use the Ubuntu One API, on several platforms. Onitu is compatible with those clients on the sole condition they allow the user to specify the server's address.\\

The Ubuntu One protocol, \textit{ubuntuone-storage-protocol}, uses Google's data organisation solution \textbf{Protocol Buffers}. Onitu uses the same protocol and the same tools.\\

The network comunication will mostly be using \textbf{Twisted}, a Python framework for \emph{event-driven} network programing. This framework is largely used and is in actif development.\\

Several libraries can be used to comunicate with the different services, through the \textit{drivers}. The choice of those libraries is left to the developers of the \textit{drivers}. However it must be reasonable and not cause any portability issues.
