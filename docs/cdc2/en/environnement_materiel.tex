\section{Hardware environement}
Several machines will be necessary in order to test the different components. Those machines can be virtualised because they won't require much ressources most of the time.\\

Most of the tests will run localy and won't require any external structures. However, from time to time, real-world tests will be required on the full product, requiring diferent machiens on different networks.\\

The portability constraints force us to conduct tests on different platforms. Machines running those different environements are required.\\

A integration server must be used in order to run the first-level test on a regular beasis.\\
