We are lucky to start this project in conditions close to what we will experience next year, if we don't take into account the time difference. This is because we are in several cities and our organisation already takes this into account. We hope this will ease the transition for next year when we will be in different countries.\\

We started by instoring a weekly meeting each wednesday evening where we disscuss the documents we are due to make and take most of the decisions concerning the project. If we feel it is necesary we call for a second meeting in the same week.

In parralell, we are constantly present on a IRC channel on which we discuss the directions the project takes. It also serves as the place where we prepare for meetings and decide the times. The meetings themselves are held on google hangout.\\

The project beeing hosted on Github we profit from the different tools it provides. A \textit{wiki} on which we publish the reports of our meetings for exemple or import discussions we had. Github also provides \textit{issues} et \textit{milestones} which we use to distribute task between members of the group and have a global vision of the deadlines.
