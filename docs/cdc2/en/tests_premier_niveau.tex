In order to ensure the project is working the way it is expected, at all times during the development process, tests are necesary.\\

Tests on each of the compomnents of the project must therefore be created at the same time the code itself is writtent. It is in particular necessary to test:\\

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item The Ubuntu One API, to ensure that all comunication with existing cliens goes as planned.
\item The correct copy and sending of files when they are added to a synchronised folder.
\item Windows
\end{itemize}

To make it easier to manage those tests and be certain that they are run on a regular basis, they will be run with a continous integration tool at each \textit{commit}. The following two tools may be used:\\

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item \href{https://travis-ci.org}{travis} which is a web-service linked to Github;
\item \href{http://jenkins-ci.org}{jenkins} which is free-software that must be installed on a server but which allows for a much larger set of tests than \textit{travis} does.
\end{itemize}
