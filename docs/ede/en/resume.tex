\textbf{\emph{\textcolor{epiBlue}{Résumé du document} } }\\

This document study what is already existing and close to our EIP, Onitu, an open-source alternative to UbuntuOne.\\
It lists different existing solutions providing cloud-storage and cloud-computing, some more or less known.\\
This lists includes Dropbox, a wll known multi-platform syncronization service,\\
SparkleShare, a collaboration oriented solution based on Git,\\
Google drive, a web-based file sharing application centered around colaboration,\\
Windows Like Skydrive, a hybrid between rich software client (Windows, Mac Os) and web applications,\\
Owncloud, a open-source browser based solution, but not verry powerfull,\\
iCloud, Apple's cloud syncronization application,\\
Syncany, a polyvalent and multi-plateform, but sadly not suported, storage service,\\
and finaly UbuntuOne on which we shall base our project because it only lacks open-source for more transparancy towards its users.
