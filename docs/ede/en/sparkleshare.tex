\subsection{Presentation}
SparkleShare is a cloud based storage solution centered around collaboration. It is based on Git to syncronnize files. It is open source software (GPLv3), compatible with GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS and Android.\\

\subsection{History}
The 1.0 version was released in december 2012 but work started in the begining of 2011 with the first public versions in February 2011.\\

\subsection{Description}
Coded in C\#, SparkleShare is entirely based on git. It is compatble with any Git repository and can thus be used with services such as Github, Bibucket and Gitorious.\\
Its usage is mostly targeted at users that want to work with other people on the same files with more confort than a clasic versioning control system.\\

\subsection{Critics}
Today, few users seem to have adapted to Sparkleshare, which is probably due to its complex instalation and to its limited use when compared to other solutions such as Dropbox or OwnCloud.\\

Git functions very well with text files but has more difficulties with binary files. It is not adviced to use SparkleShare with multimedia files.\\
Furthermore Sparkleshare does not offer any compatibility with more standart protocols such as HTTP, FTP or Websac.\\
