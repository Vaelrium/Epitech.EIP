\textbf{\emph{\textcolor{epiBlue}{Document synopsis} } }

This document, based on the Onitu project's features, which are detailed in the Cahier des Charges, presents their organization and planification.

It will first report the risks, hypothesis and constraints due to the project building, and the way we'll handle it during the development phase.

Then it presents the features list, representing them on a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) tree. Those features, grouped in lots, and scaled using milestones described further, are finally positioned on a Gantt chart, which permits a global and synthetic view of the project.
