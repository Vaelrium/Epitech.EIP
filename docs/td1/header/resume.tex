\textbf{\emph{\textcolor{onitu}{\large{Document summary} } } }\\

Being an opensource project, it is very important for us to have a good relationship with our users. Some of them might even help us with bug repports or by writing code for their specific needs.

In order to achieve this, a good technical documentation that makes it easy for those people to understand and contribute to our project is essential.

That is what this document is all about. It provides insight into all the major parts of the projects, gives details about how to approach it, the global architecture, the technical choices, and a gloassary. On a deeper level it provides information about the building blocks of Onitu and the different components that developers have to interact with. In addition to this it provides guidelines for coding style and good practises for contributing to the project.
