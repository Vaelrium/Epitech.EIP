There is today a number of online file storage and synchronization solutions. But those services are totally opaque for the user, who thus has no control over his own data.

With Onitu, we wish to solve this problem, by offering you a way to configure on your own, and in a simple way, the storage of your files. Indeed, Onitu can be installed by anyone, and lets you choose on which services you transfer your data.

To achieve this, we rely on a number of software units (called *drivers*) able to communicate with external services (like *Dropbox* or *Google Drive*) as well as internal ones (local storage). You can also create transfer rules, which are used to tell Onitu on which services store which files. These rules are reviewed in detail in the Chapter 3 of this document.

At last, Onitu will allow you to manage it using a Web interface, directly from your favorite Web browser.
